# TriggersPractice
This has a list of Triggers for the hands-on practice.

Trigger - 1

When an Account is created/updated, write a trigger to ensure a value in the 'Phone' field. It should never be null. If it is null, make sure the trigger throws an error at the Phone field on the Account record. Also, write a test class for the same.


Trigger - 2

When an Account record is created/updated, write a trigger that updates the Shipping Address with the Billing Address values. Write a test class for the same.
